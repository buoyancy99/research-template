# scirpts

`scripts` folder contains bash scripts for you to scale up your project on cloud.
Create a new folder under the name of your algorithm or project and put your bash scripts in it.

General scripts that are useful for all projects can be put in the `script` folder directly.

We provide an interactive script `submit_job.py` for slurm clusters.
The script is written for MIT's supercloud and satori, but adding your cluster should be easy.
